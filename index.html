        <p>And if you don’t want your contacts to know whether you have read a message yourself you
        can simply disable that feature in the settings.</p>

        <p>XMPP is a federated protocol, which means you can freely choose a trustworthy server for
        yourself while still chatting with contacts that are using other servers. The communication
        between Conversations and the XMPP server as well as the communication between the
        individual servers is TLS encrypted.</p>

        <p>This way, not only your messages are safe but more importantly it is impossible for an
        outside attacker to intercept your meta data (with whom you are chatting) without attacking
        your server first.</p>

        <p>On top of that, Conversations gives you the choice to enable one of three end-to-end
        encryption mechanisms. The first one is <a href="/omemo/">OMEMO</a>, a state of the art
        multi-end-to-multi-end encryption method  which is very easy to setup and gives you
        forward secrecy and plausible deniability.</p>

        <p>For backwards compatibility reasons Conversations also supports OTR and OpenPGP.</p>

      <div class="col-lg-8" style="margin-bottom: 0px">
        <p>XMPP is an extensible protocol. These extensions are defined in so called XEPs.
        Conversations supports a couple of those XEPs to improve reliability and all in all provide
        for a better user experience.</p>

        <p>There is a chance that your current XMPP server does not support these extensions;
        therefore to get the most out of Conversations you should consider either switching to an
        XMPP server that does or — even better — run your own XMPP server for you and your
        friends.</p>

        <p>We also made it very easy to register an account on our very own XMPP server
        <a href="https://account.conversations.im"><em>conversations.im</em></a>.</p>

        <h3 class="offsetanchor" id="optimizations">Mobile optimizations</h3>

        <p>The internet connection on cell phones is rather unstable. It constantly switches
        between WiFi and 3G and might even drop out on occasion. The <a href=
        "https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html">XEP-0198: Stream Managment</a> allows
        Conversations to survive those switches. Instead of having to establish a completely new
        session the servers gives the client a 5 minute window to resume a previously established
        session. Messages that arrived in the mean time will be redelivered automatically.</p>

        <p>Stream management also minimizes traffic by sparing the client from fetching static
        information (contact list, conference bookmark, avatars) on every connect.</p>

        <p>Using <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0352.html">XEP-0352: Client State
        Indication</a> Conversations communicates to the server whether or not the client is in the
        background right now. Based on this information, the server can withhold unimportant
        packages and thus allowing the client to stay in deep sleep for longer.</p>

        <h3 class="offsetanchor" id="synchronization">Message synchronization</h3>

        <p>You are no longer limited to one device. If you are online with multiple devices
        simultaneously, the <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0280.html">XEP-0280: Message
        Carbons</a> will be used to send copies of both your sent and received messages to all
        devices.</p>

        <p>If you are installing Conversations on a new device or catching up after being offline
        for a while, Conversations will use <a href=
        "https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html">XEP-0313: Message Archive Management</a> to
        fetch the message history from your server.</p>

        <h3 class="offsetanchor" id="confirmation">Message confirmation</h3>

        <p>Your contact isn’t responding immediately? Conversations uses <a href=
        "https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0333.html">XEP-0333: Chat Markers</a> to inform you when
        your messages have been read.
        <br>
        And since Conversations cares about your privacy you can
        easily opt-out of this feature as well.</p>

        <p>Are your contacts still using old, unreliable clients? Turn on <a href=
        "https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0184.html">XEP-0184: Message Delivery Receipts</a> in the
        <em>expert settings</em> to make sure your contacts have successfully received your messages.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-12" style="margin-bottom: 0px">
        <h3 class="offsetanchor" id="avatars">Contact pictures</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-lg-6">
        <p>Put a face to your contacts. Conversations lets you upload a profile picture (Avatar) to your
        server for all your contacts to see by utilizing the PEP based <a href=
        "https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0084.html">XEP-0084: User Avatar</a>. Contrary to other methods
        of publishing avatars, the PEP based approach handles data usage more efficiently by separating data
        and meta data.</p>
        <p>On top of that, Conversations allows you to use the contact name and pictures provided by the
        Android address book.</p>
        <h3 class="offsetanchor" id="tags">Dynamic tags</h3>

        <p>Conversations gives old features a new spin. Being able to organize your contacts into groups
        has been an XMPP feature for a long time. However, instead of the tree-like representation
        most XMPP clients provide, Conversations uses a tag based approach, letting you easily search for any group or status.<br>
        To keep Conversations as simple as possible, this feature is turned off by default. If you
        need to handle a large contact base, you can enable it via the <em>Show dynamic tags</em>
        switch in the settings.</p>

        <p>This is a short excerpt of the entire, much more detailed FAQ that can be found in the <a href=
        "https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> at our GitHub repository.</p>
        <h5>How do I install Conversations?</h5>
        <p>Conversations is entirely open source and licensed under GPLv3. So if you are a software developer, you can check out the sources from <a href="https://github.com/siacs/Conversations">GitHub</a> and use gradle to build your APK file.</p>
        <p>The more convenient way — which not only gives you automatic updates but also supports the further development of Conversations — is to buy the App in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.siacs.conversations&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite">Google Play Store</a>.</p>
        <p>Buying the App from the Play Store will also give you access to our <a href="#beta">beta test</a>.</p>
        <h5>How do I create an account?</h5>
        <p>XMPP, like email, is a federated protocol, which means that there is not one company you can create an <em>official XMPP account</em> with. Instead there are hundreds, or even thousands, of providers out there. One of those providers is our very own <a href="https://account.conversations.im"><em>conversations.im</em></a>. If you don’t like to use <em>conversations.im</em> use a web search engine of your choice to find another provider. Or maybe your university has one. Or you can run your own. Or ask a friend to run one. Once you've found one, you can use Conversations to create an account. Just select <em>register new account on server</em> within the create account dialog.</p>
	<h6>Domain hosting</h6>
	<p>Using your own domain not only gives you a more recognizable Jabber ID, it also gives you the flexibility to migrate your account between different XMPP providers. This is a good compromise between the responsibilities of having to operate your own server and the downsides of being dependent on a single provider.</p>
	<p>Learn more about <a href="https://account.conversations.im/domain">conversations.im Jabber/XMPP domain hosting</a>.</p>
	<h6>Running your own</h6>
	<p>If you already have a server somewhere and are willing and able to put the necessary work in, one alternative-in the spirit of federation-is to run your own. We recommend either <a href="https://prosody.im">Prosody</a> or <a href="https://www.ejabberd.im">ejabberd</a>. Both of which have their own strengths. Ejabberd is slightly more mature nowadays but Prosody is arguably easier to set up.</p>

	<p>For Prosody you need a couple of so called <a href="https://modules.prosody.im/">community modules</a> most of which are maintained by the same people that develop Prosody.</p>
	<p>If you pick ejabberd make sure you use the latest version. Linux Distributions might bundle some very old versions of it.</p>
        <h5 id="dns" class="offsetanchor">How can I set up a custom hostname and port?</h5>
        <p>Conversations will automatically look up the SRV records for your domain name, which can point to any hostname port combination. If your server doesn’t provide those, please contact your admin and have them read <a href="http://prosody.im/doc/dns#srv_records">this document on the prosody wiki</a>. If your server operator is unwilling to fix this you can enable advanced server settings in the expert settings of Conversations.</p>
        <h5>How does the address book integration work?</h5>
        <p>The address book integration was designed to protect your privacy. Conversations neither uploads contacts from your address book to your server nor fills your address book with unnecessary contacts from your online roster. If you manually add a Jabber ID to your phones address book, Conversations will use the name and the profile picture of this contact. To make the process of adding Jabber IDs to your address book easier, you can click on the profile picture in the contact details within Conversations. This will start an <em>add to address book</em> intent with the JID as the payload. This doesn’t require Conversations to have write permissions on your address book, but also doesn't require you to copy/paste a JID from one app to another.</p>

    <h1>Development</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-lg-7">
        <p>Conversations is being developed on <a href="https://github.com/siacs/Conversations">GitHub</a> by a team of volunteers under the lead of project founder and maintainer
        <a href="https://gultsch.de">Daniel <em>inputmice</em> Gultsch</a>. Translations are being managed on <a href="https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/conversations/">Transifex</a>.</p>
        <h3>Helping out</h3>
        <p>The Conversations Team is always looking for new volunteers to fix bugs, develop new features or for simply providing unique and fresh ideas that help Conversations to stay the most advanced and easiest to use XMPP client out there.</p>
        <p>Start out by searching our <a href="https://github.com/siacs/Conversations/issues">issue tracker</a> for open tickets or get to know us in our group chat on <a href="xmpp:conversations@conference.siacs.eu?join">conversations@conference.siacs.eu</a>
        <p>We are also looking for translators. Transifex provides a very easy to use GUI. You just need to create an account and request to join a language team.</p>
        <h3 class="offsetanchor" id="beta">Beta Testing</h3>
        <p>If you bought the App on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.siacs.conversations&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite">Google Play</a>,
        you can get access to the latest beta version by joining the <a href=
        "https://plus.google.com/communities/107649347599361240873">Conversations Beta Testers</a> community on Google+ and then
        using <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/eu.siacs.conversations&referrer=utm_source%3Dwebsite">this link</a> to sign up for the beta test.</p>
        <p>New versions usually come out at the beginning of each month, with beta versions about a week prior to that.</p>
        <h3>Customizations</h3>
        <p>Conversations also provides you with a great base to create your own instant messenger for your customers or employees. If you don’t have the time or resources to do this yourself you can hire the lead developer Daniel Gultsch to provide you with the solution you need.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Daniel added a couple of features we needed to be able to roll out Conversations to our users, one was support for server side group bookmarks, the other one was avatars. Development was professional and we got early snapshots to test ourselves, the features then got added to the next public release. I can highly recommend hiring Daniel.</p>
